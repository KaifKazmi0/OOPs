⭐ Final Correct Rules for Interface Method Resolution in Java
✔ Rule 1:
If a method exists ONLY as a default (no abstract version anywhere) → default is used.

Example:

Only Multimedia has default start()

Engine does NOT have start()

👉 Car does NOT need to override.
👉 Multimedia's default start() runs.

✔ Rule 2:
If BOTH interfaces have default methods with the SAME signature → Car MUST override.

Reason: Conflict (Java doesn’t know which default to use)

👉 Car must provide its own implementation.

✔ Rule 3 (IMPORTANT):
If ANY interface has the method as abstract → Car MUST override, even if other interfaces have default.

This is your case:

Engine → void start(); (abstract)

Multimedia → default void start()

Because of Engine’s abstract method:

👉 Car MUST override start()
👉 Multimedia’s default is IGNORED
