What is an Abstract Class?

An abstract class is a class in Java that cannot be instantiated (you cannot create an object of it) and is meant to be inherited by other classes.

It is used when:
You want to provide partial implementation.
You want to enforce common structure for all subclasses.

It may contain:
Abstract methods (methods without a body)
Normal methods (methods with body)
Variables, constructors, static methods (yes it's allowed)


Key Points

You cannot create objects of an abstract class.
Animal a = new Animal(); // ❌ not allowed
It can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
Subclasses must override all abstract methods.
Constructors of abstract classes run when subclass objects are created.
